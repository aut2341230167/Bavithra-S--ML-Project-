# 📈 LSTM-Based Stock Price Prediction – Tata Motors & Infosys

This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict the **next day's closing price** of two Indian stocks:
- Tata Motors
- Infosys

## 📁 Files Included
- `Tata Motors Limited.csv` – 5 years of historical OHLCV data
- `Infosys Limited.csv` – 5 years of historical OHLCV data
- `lstm_model.py` – Full Python code for data preprocessing, LSTM training, and prediction
- `tata_model.h5` – Saved LSTM model for Tata Motors
- `infosys_model.h5` – Saved LSTM model for Infosys
